## Statistical Analysis in Hip Arthroplasty

This repository contains the statistical analyses conducted for a retrospective study that evaluated the influence of the baricity of bupivacaine used in spinal anesthesia on perioperative outcomes of patients undergoing hip arthroplasty. The study was conducted at Rede D'Or hospitals and is currently under review for publication in a scientific journal.

### Project Outcomes
- **Scientific Research:** *ANALYSIS OF ANESTHETIC TECHNIQUE FOR HIP ARTHROPLASTY AND POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES* - Currently under review in a medical journal.
- **Anesthesiology Residency Thesis:** *Relationship between the baricity of the local anesthetic used in spinal anesthesia and outcomes of patients undergoing hip arthroplasty: a retrospective cohort* - Completed in December 2022.
- **Award:** 2nd place at the II International Symposium on Quality and Safety of Rede D'Or with the work *Predictive analysis by machine learning algorithms in major orthopedic surgery: cost-effectiveness and impact on postoperative outcome* - Presented in April 2023.

### Project Objective
To evaluate whether the baricity of the local anesthetic (isobaric vs. hyperbaric bupivacaine) influences critical outcomes such as intraoperative hypotension, use of vasoactive drugs, need for blood transfusion, and length of hospital stay.

### Methodology
- **Study Type:** Retrospective cohort.
- **Period:** January 2016 to December 2021.
- **Location:** Rede D'Or Hospitals (São Luiz Itaim, Anália Franco, Villa Lobos).
- **Population:** Patients undergoing hip arthroplasty during the study period, with data collected via electronic medical records.

### Statistical Analysis
Multivariate analysis was used to adjust confounding factors and calculate prevalence ratios (PR) for outcomes. Analyses were performed using R program® software, and included tests of normality, Poisson regression with robust variance to estimate relative risk effect sizes, and variable selection through stepwise.

### Key Results
- **Intraoperative Hypotension:** Isobaric bupivacaine was associated with a higher incidence of hypotension compared to hyperbaric bupivacaine.
- **Use of Vasoactive Drugs:** There was a higher need for vasopressors among patients who received isobaric bupivacaine.
- **Length of Hospital Stay:** Patients who received hyperbaric bupivacaine had a shorter hospital stay.

### Personal Contributions
As a statistician, I was responsible for the entire data analysis process, from variable selection, model fitting, to interpretation of results. Identifying the relationship between the baricity of the anesthetic and clinical outcomes, aiding in the formulation of recommendations for safer and more effective anesthetic practices.
